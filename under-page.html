			Drake's worldwide smash One Dance from 2016 is his most streamed song, with 324 million plays to date. The track, which held the top spot on the Official Singles Chart for 15 weeks, is one of the UK's most-streamed songs of all time.
		</div>
			<div class="box-2">
			Drake has two more songs that have broken the 200 million streaming barrier. His second most-streamed track is 2018's nine-week Number 1 God's Plan, with 267 million plays. The song set a record at the time for most global plays in a day on Apple Music, with 14 million streams in 24 hours. 
		</div>	
			<div class="box-3">
			Meanwhile, in third place is Nice For What, Drake's fourth leader in 2018. The Lauryn Hill-sampling track spent just a week at the summit - a short spell for a Drake chart-topper - but continues to rack up huge plays, currently at 207 million in the UK.
